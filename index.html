    <h1>Central Valley Recharge Basin Project</h1>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>California, specifically Fresno County, has a history of decreasing water levels over the last 100 years. With around a 100 feet decline of groundwater since the 1930s, due to water pumping, it is negatively affecting the ability for our communities to access safe and reliable groundwater. Assembly Bill 685 took place in September 2012 to ensure that everyone has equal access to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water. Thus, it is important that as a community we work towards this goal to ensure our needs are met.</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Groundwater recharge is one of the most effective and feasible solutions to achieving the desirable quality and quantity of the communities groundwater. Our mission is to increase the use of water recharge basins which would work to replenish our underground aquifers and as a result increase groundwater levels. The California Water Institute (CWI) wants to encourage farmers to use their unused land for water recharge basins. These projects can be costly for these farmers. To facilitate the calculation of costs for these farmers and whether it is the correct decision, we are implementing this online calculator that will ask the farmers for their input and give them an estimated cost and return on investment overtime.</p>
